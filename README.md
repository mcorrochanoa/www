My personal website built with [Astro](https://astro.build). Here you can find all stuff related to my digital garden. The goal is to use vanilla JS in most cases. Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

### Run the project

1. Install the dependencies.

```shell
pnpm install
```

2. Start the dev server.

```
